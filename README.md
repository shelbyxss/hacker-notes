# 💀 hacker-notes

🕳️ Shelbyxss’s personal notebook of web exploits, whisper traps, and browser-layer subversion.  
This repo documents hands-on work from my 15-week journey into ethical hacking — focused on application abuse, stealth, and security bypasses.

---

## 🧠 Current Focus
- Web exploitation (XSS, CORS, JWT abuse)
- Accessibility-layer phishing (ARIA + screen reader traps)
- OSINT, signal-layer exploits, and interaction jamming
